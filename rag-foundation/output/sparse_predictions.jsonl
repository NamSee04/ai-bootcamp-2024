In contrast, their semantic feature approach, which leverages word embeddings, aims to reduce the vocabulary gap for unseen topics and exact lexical representations, making it more robust to changes in controversies over time.", "predicted_evidence": ["Controversy detection is a difficult task because 1) controversies are latent, like ideology, meaning they are often not directly mentioned as controversial in text. 2) Controversies occur across a vast range of topics with varying topic-specific vocabularies. 3) Controversies change over time, with some topics and actors becoming controversial whereas others stop to be so. Previous approaches lack the power to deal with such changes. Matching and explicit approaches are problematic when the source corpus (e.g. Wikipedia) lags after real-world changes BIBREF8 . Furthermore, lexical methods trained on common (e.g. fulltext) features are likely to memorize the controversial topics in the training set rather than the `language of controversy'. Alleviating dependence on platform specific features and reducing sensitivity to an exact lexical representation is paramount to robust controversy detection. To this end, we focus only on fulltext features and suggest to leverage the semantic representations of word embeddings to reduce the vocabulary-gap for unseen topics and exact lexical representations.", "Prior work on detecting controversies has taken three kinds of approaches: 1) lexical approaches, which seek to detect controversies through signal terms, either through bag-of-word classifiers, lexicons, or lexicon based language models BIBREF1 . 2) explicit modeling of controversy through platform-specific features, often in Wikipedia or social-media settings. Features such as mutual reverts BIBREF2 , user-provided flags BIBREF3 , interaction networks BIBREF4 or stance-distributions BIBREF5 have been used as platform-specific indicators of controversies. The downside of these approaches is the lack of generalizability due to their platform-specific nature. 3) matching models that combine lexical and explicit modelling approaches by looking at lexical similarities between a given text and a set of texts in a domain that provides explicit features BIBREF1 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 .", "The majority of NLP-task related neural architectures rely on word embeddings, popularized by Mikolov et al BIBREF9 to represent texts. In essence these embeddings are latent-vector representations that aim to capture the underlying meaning of words. Distances between such latent-vectors are taken to express semantic relatedness, despite having different surface forms. By using embeddings, neural architectures are also able to leverage features learned on other texts (e.g. pretrained word embeddings) and create higher level representations of input (e.g. convolutional feature maps or hidden-states). These properties suggest that neural approaches are better able to generalize to unseen examples that poorly match the training set. We use two often applied network architectures adopting word embeddings, to classify controversy: Recurrent Neural Networks BIBREF10 and Convolutional Neural Networks BIBREF11 to answer the following research question.

While the scores of the feature-based approach are significantly lower than those obtained via full fine-tuning (TABREF27), we see that MMTE still outperforms mBERT on both in-language and zero-shot settings by an even bigger margin. This is particularly interesting as the feature-based approach has its own advantages: 1) it is applicable to downstream tasks which require significant task-specific parameters on top of a transformer encoder, 2) it is computationally cheaper to train and tune the downstream model, and 3) it is compact and scalable since we only need a small number of task-specific parameters."]}

Generating keyphrases can be seen as a particular instantiation of text summarization, where the goal is not to produce a well-formed piece of text, but a coherent set of phrases that convey the most salient information. Those phrases may or may not appear in the document, the latter requiring some form of abstraction to be generated. State-of-the-art systems for this task rely on recurrent neural networks BIBREF2, BIBREF3, BIBREF4, and hence require large amounts of annotated training data to achieve good performance.

In contrast, non-expert annotators (such as authors) use a larger, less controlled vocabulary, with frequent keyphrases that are less precise.

We see that non-expert annotators use a larger, less controlled indexing vocabulary, in part because they lack the higher level of domain expertise that editors have. For example, we observe that frequent keyphrases in KPTimes are close to topic descriptors (e.g. \u201cBaseball\u201c, \u201cPolitics and Government\u201c) while those appearing only once are very precise (e.g. \u201cMarley's Cafe\u201c, \u201cCatherine E.

Here, we divert these annotations from their primary purpose, and use them as gold-standard labels to automatically build our dataset.

We then explore the resulting dataset to better understand how editors tag documents, and how these expert annotations differ from author-assigned keyphrases found in scholarly documents.

Inspired by the fact that embeddings from different layers excel in different tasks, we also conducted experiments by concatenating embeddings from multiple layers. The results are presented in Table TABREF3, and the raw values are provided in the Appendix."]}

Our findings are consistent with BIBREF12 work on assessing BERT's syntactic abilities. Fine-tuning on natural language inference datasets improves the quality of sentence embedding, especially on semantic similarity tasks and entailment tasks. Combining embeddings from two layers can further boost the performance on sentence surface and syntactic information probing tasks. Experiments were also conducted by combining embeddings from multiple layers. However, there is no significant and consistent improvement over pooling just from two layers. Adding multi-layer perceptron (MLP) instead of logistic regression layer on top of the embeddings also provides no significant changes in performance, which suggests that most linguistic properties can be extracted with just a linear readout of the embeddings. Our best model is the combination of embeddings from the top and bottom layer of the BERT fine-tuned on SNLI dataset.", "Universal text representations are important for many NLP tasks as modern deep learning models are becoming more and more data-hungry and computationally expensive. On one hand, most research and industry tasks face data sparsity problem due to the high cost of annotation. Universal text representations can mitigate this problem to a certain extent by performing implicit transfer learning among tasks. On the other hand, modern deep learning models with millions of parameters are expensive to train and host, while models using text representation as the building blocks can achieve similar performance with much fewer tunable parameters. The pre-computed text embeddings can also help decrease model latency dramatically at inference time.", "When evaluated on non-factoid QA datasets, there is a big gap between BERT embeddings and the fully fine-tuned BERT, which suggests that deep interactions between questions and answers are critical to the task. However, the gap is much smaller for factoid QA datasets. Since non-factoid QA depends more on content matching rather than vocabulary matching, the results are kind of expected. Similar to BERT for sentence embeddings, mean-pooling and combining the top and bottom layer embeddings lead to better performance, and $(u, v, u * v, |u - v|)$ shows the strongest results among other interaction schemes. Different from sentence-level embeddings, fine-tuning BERT on SNLI doesn't lead to significant improvement, which suggests possible domain mismatch between SNLI and the QA datasets. MLP layer usually provided a 1-2 percent boost in performance compared to the logistic regression layer."]}

In addition, focusing on the system development time, generating and implementing those features in the conventional model would take days or even weeks. However, the CNN model automatically learns its optimal feature representation and can adjust the features automatically across data sets. This makes the CNN model quite versatile for supporting different tasks and data domains.

We compared two types of leading text-based humor recognition methods: a conventional classifier (e.g., Random Forest) based on human-engineered features vs. an end-to-end CNN method, which relies on its inherent representation learning.

The effectiveness of attention mechanisms have been proven for the task of neural machine translation BIBREF1 and it has the same effect in this case. The goal of attention mechanisms in such tasks is to derive context vectors which capture relevant source side information and help predict the current target representation. The sequence of annotations generated by the encoder to come up with a context vector capturing how each sub-word contributes to the record's clickbait quotient is of paramount importance to this model. In a typical RNN encoder-decoder framework BIBREF1 , a context vector is generated at each time-step to predict the target sub-word.

This is the entire text of the article whose title has been given. By definition, clickbait articles differ from the content described in their headline. We generate document embeddings for both the title and the article text and perform element wise multiplication over the two. This allows us to capture the interaction between the two, something which has not been used before. Since the title is supposed to mislead the reader with respect to the content, modeling this interaction in terms of their similarity gives an added dimenstion to our approach.

Fig. FIGREF16 (e) shows that without main module, our model fails to do image manipulation on both datasets, which just achieves an identity mapping.

BIBREF54 built small domain-specific translation models for ontology translation from relevant sentence pairs that were identified in a parallel corpus based on the ontology labels to be translated. With this approach they improve the translation quality over the usage of large generic translation models. Since the generation of translation models can be computational expensive, BIBREF55 use large generic translation models to translate ontology labels, which were placed into a disambiguated context. With this approach the authors demonstrate translation quality improvement over commercial systems, like Microsoft Translator."]}

We have also seen that Twitter data matches populations better when population numbers are weighted by GDP and worse when weighted by internet-usage statistics. This implies that Twitter as a platform represents more wealthy populations than general web-crawled data. An alternate interpretation is that the Twitter collection here is based on urban areas, which tend to have more wealthy populations.

The number of table index in WikiTableQuestions is 2,108, which is smaller than the number of table index in WebQueryTable. We randomly split the 22,033 question-table pairs into training (70%), development (10%) and test (20%).", "There exists several works in database community that aims at finding related tables from keyword queries.

VLDB2012IBM focus on the queries that describe table columns, and retrieve tables based on column mapping. There also exists table-related studies such as searching related tables from a table BIBREF16 , assembling a table from list in web page BIBREF17 and extracting tables using tabular structure from web page BIBREF18 . Our work differs from this line of research in that we focus on exploring the content of table to find relevant tables from web queries.", "This is different from the phenomenon in WebQueryTable that the most effective aspect is caption. We believe that this is because the questions in WikiTableQuestions typically include content constrains from cells or headers. Two randomly sampled questions are \u201cwhich country won the 1994 europeans men's handball championship's preliminary round?\" and \u201cwhat party had 7,115 inactive voters as of october 25, 2005?\". On the contrary, queries from WebTableQuery usually do not use information from specific headers or cells. Examples include \u201cpolish rivers\", \u201cworld top 5 mountains\" and \u201clist of american cruise lines\". From Table 1 , we can also find that the question in WikiTableQuestions are longer than the queries in WebQueryTable. In addition, we observe that not all the questions from WikiTableQuestions are suitable for table retrieval. An example is \u201cwhat was the first player to be drafted in this table?\"."]}

This different behavior between uas and las seems to be originated by the fact that 2-task dependency parsing models, which are the basis for the corresponding auxiliary task and mtl models, improve uas but not las with respect to single-task dependency parsing models. The reason might be that the single-task setup excludes unlikely combinations of dependency labels with PoS tags or dependency directions that are not found in the training set, while in the 2-task setup, both components are treated separately, which may be having a negative influence on dependency labeling accuracy.", "We also use the spmrl datasets, a collection of parallel dependency and constituency treebanks for morphologically rich languages BIBREF42 .

If no match is found with a true phone boundary, this is considered to be a false negative. The consistency of the units was evaluated in term of normalized mutual information (NMI - see BIBREF1 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF5 for details) which measures the statistical dependency between the units and the forced aligned phones. A NMI of 0 % means that the units are completely independent of the phones whereas a NMI of 100 % indicates that the actual phones could be retrieved without error given the sequence of discovered units.", "We then evaluated the effect of the informative prior on the acoustic unit discovery (Table TABREF23 ).

The motivation is to encourage the model to fill in the missing token (or correct the semantic error) based on the contextual information with less acoustic evidence, and consequently, the model may have a stronger language modeling power and is more robust to acoustic distortions.", "Our masking approach requires the alignment information in order to perform the token-wise masking as shown in Figure FIGREF2.

During model training, we randomly select a percentage of the tokens and mask the corresponding speech segments in each iteration.

Namely, we used the XGBoost algorithm BIBREF43 , an implementation of the gradient-boosted decision trees for this task. Training a decision tree learning algorithm involves the generation of a series of rules, split points or nodes ordered in a tree-like structure enabling the prediction of a target output value based on the values of the input features. More specifically, XGBoost, as an ensemble technique, is trained by sequentially adding a high number of individually weak but complementary classifiers to produce a robust estimator: each new model is built to be maximally correlated with the negative gradient of the loss function associated with the model assembly BIBREF44 . To evaluate the performance of this method we benchmarked it against more standard ensemble learning algorithms such as AdaBoost and Random Forest.", "For each socioeconomic dataset, we trained our models by using 75% of the available data for training and the remaining 25% for testing. During the training phase, the training data undergoes a INLINEFORM0 -fold inner cross-validation, with INLINEFORM1 , where all splits are computed in a stratified manner to get the same ratio of lower to higher SES users. The four first blocks were used for inner training and the remainder for inner testing. This was repeated ten times for each model so that in the end, each model's performance on the validation set was averaged over 50 samples. For each model, the parameters were fine-tuned by training 500 different models over the aforementioned splits. The selected one was that which gave the best performance on average, which was then applied to the held-out test set. This is then repeated through a 5-fold outer cross-validation.", "We hence used it for our predictions in the remainder of this study. We found that the LinkedIn data was the best, with INLINEFORM0 , to train a model to predict SES of people based on their semantic features. It provided a INLINEFORM1 increase in performance as compared to the census based inference with INLINEFORM2 , and INLINEFORM3 relative to expert annotated data with INLINEFORM4 . Thus we can conclude that there seem to be a trade-off between scalability and prediction quality, as while the occupation dataset provided the best results, it seems unlikely to be subject to any upscaling due to the high cost of obtaining a clean dataset. Relying on location to estimate SES seems to be more likely to benefit from such an approach, though at the cost of an increased number of mislabelled users in the dataset. Moreover, the annotator's estimation of SES using Street View at each home location seems to be hindered by the large variability of urban features. Note that even though inter-agreement is 76%, the Cohen's kappa score for annotator inter-agreement is low at 0.169."]}

We propose different data collection and combination strategies using open, crawlable, or expert annotated socioeconomic data for the prediction task. Specifically, we use an extensive Twitter dataset of 1.3M users located in France, all associated with their tweets and profile information; 32,053 of them having inferred home locations. Individual SES is estimated by relying on three separate datasets, namely socioeconomic census data; crawled profession information and expert annotated Google Street View images of users' home locations. Each of these datasets is then used as ground-truth to infer the SES of Twitter users from profile and semantic features similar to BIBREF9 . We aim to explore and assess how the SES of social media users can be obtained and how much the inference problem depends on annotation and the user's individual and linguistic attributes.", "We can identify several future directions and applications of our work. First, further development of data annotation of remotely sensed information is a promising direction. Note that after training, our model requires as input only information, which can be collected exclusively from Twitter, without relying on other data sources. This holds a large potential in terms of SES inference of larger sets of Twitter users, which in turn opens the door for studies to address population level correlations of SES with language, space, time, or the social network. This way our methodology has the merit not only to answer open scientific questions, but also to contribute to the development of new applications in recommendation systems, predicting customer behavior, or in online social services."]}

The same is true for the null hypothesis that male pronouns are not significantly more frequent than gender neutral pronouns, with the one exception of the Basque language (which exhibits a rather strong tendency towards neutral pronouns). The null hypothesis that neutral pronouns are not significantly more frequent than female ones is accepted with much more frequency, namely for the languages Malay, Estonian, Finnish, Hungarian, Armenian and for the categories Farming & Fishing & Forestry, Healthcare, Legal, Arts & Entertainment, Education.

Adjectives such as Shy and Desirable are translated with a larger proportion of female pronouns, while Guilty and Cruel are almost exclusively translated with male ones.

Moreover, the embedding information of a user is shared, so the learning habits and language talents of the user could be shared in the unified model for other low-resource language-learning tasks.

It can be found that our method outperforms all the state-of-the-art baselines when the training data of a language dataset is insufficient, which is a huge improvement compared with the existing methods.

The authors of BIBREF8 hypothesize that the so-called residual mapping of $y=F(x)+x$ should be easier to optimize than the original mapping of $y=F(x)$. The design of the special building block is motivated by the observation in BIBREF6, BIBREF7 that accuracy degrades when more layers are stacked onto an already very deep CNN model. If the added layers can be constructed as identity mappings, the deeper model should not have worse training error than the original shallower model without these added layers. The degradation actually suggests that the optimizer has difficulties in approximating identity mappings. With the identity shortcut connections in the ResNet building block, the optimizer can simply drive the layer weights toward zero to make the block identity mapping.

With the standard architecture, while the length of the encoder states always depends on the source sentence, at each timestep the decoder only has access to a fixed representation of the encoder (context vector from attention).

Instead of relying fully on a fixed-sized state vector, an attention mechanism allows each decoder word prediction step to extract relevant information from past states through a key-value query mechanism. However, this mechanism connects every input token with all preceeding ones via a computational step, increasing the complexity of the calculation to $O(N^2)$ for an input sequence size N. In the ideal case, the mapping of input conversation history to output response would have a computational complexity of $O(N)$.

Here's a high-level overview of the proof:\n\n1. **Encoding the PDA**: The PDA is encoded into the RNN's weights and initial state. The encoding represents the PDA's transition function, stack operations, and acceptance criteria.\n2. **Simulating the PDA's computation**: The RNN processes the input sequence one token at a time, using its recurrent connections to maintain a \"stack\" of hidden states. At each time step, the RNN updates its hidden state based on the current input, the previous hidden state, and the encoded PDA transition function.\n3. **Stack operations**: The RNN's hidden state is used to simulate the PDA's stack operations (push, pop, and top). The RNN's weights are designed to ensure that the hidden state accurately reflects the PDA's stack configuration.\n4. **Acceptance criteria**: The RNN's output is designed to indicate whether the input sequence is accepted or rejected by the PDA. This is typically done by using a special output neuron that is activated when the PDA would accept the input.\n\nBy carefully designing the RNN's architecture and weights, it is possible to show that the RNN can simulate the behavior of any PDA, thereby demonstrating that RNNs with arbitrary precision are at least as powerful as PDAs.\n\nThe key insight behind this proof is that the RNN's recurrent connections can be used to maintain a \"stack\" of hidden states, which allows the RNN to simulate the PDA's stack operations. This is possible because the RNN's hidden state can be thought of as a \"summary\" of the input sequence seen so far, which can be used to make predictions about the next input token.\n\nThe proof is often based on the idea of \"computational universality,\" which means that the RNN can simulate any computation that can be performed by a PDA. This is typically done by showing that the RNN can simulate a universal PDA, which is a PDA that can simulate any other PDA.", "predicted_evidence": ["Discussion 1.12. This result shows that simple RNNs with arbitrary precision are at least as computationally powerful as PDAs.", "Motivated by these earlier theoretical results, in this report we seek to show results about the computational power of recurrent architectures actually used in practice - namely, those that read tokens one at a time and that use standard rather than specially chosen activation functions. In particular we will prove that, allowing infinite precision, RNNs with just one hidden layer and ReLU activation are at least as powerful as PDAs, and that GRUs are at least as powerful as deterministic finite automata (DFAs). Furthermore, we show that using infinite edge weights and a non-standard output function, GRUs are also at least as powerful as PDAs.", "Because to the our knowledge there is no analogue of the Chomsky-Sch INLINEFORM0 tzenberger Theorem for Turing recognizable languages, it seems difficult to directly extend our methods to prove that recurrent architectures are as computationally powerful as Turing machines. However, just as PDAs can lazily be described as a DFA with an associated stack, it is well-known that Turing machines are equally as powerful as DFAs with associated queues, which can be simulated with two stacks. Such an approach using two counters was used in proofs in [6], [8] to establish that RNNs with arbitrary precision can emulate Turing machines. We believe that an approach related to this fact could ultimately prove successful, but it would be more useful if set up as in the proofs above in a way that is faithful to the architecture of the neural networks. Counter automata of this sort are also quite unlike the usual implementations found for context-free languages or their extensions for natural languages."]}

Second, methods that distinguish reviews, such as D-ATT and MPCN, often outperform DeepCoNN, which suggests that different reviews exhibit different degrees of importance for modeling users and items. We also observe that HUITA does not show superiority over DeepCoNN. This may stem from its symmetric style of attention learning, which does not make much sense when reviews are heterogeneous.

Humans communicate effectively with each other, thanks to their shared mental models of the physical world and social context BIBREF2. These models foster reciprocal trust by making contextual knowledge transparent; they are also crucial for explaining how decision-making unfolds. In a similar fashion, we can assert that `explainable AI' is a byproduct or an affordance of computational context understanding and is predicated on the extent to which humans can introspect the decision processes that enable machine sense-making BIBREF3.", "Based on our experimental results and error analysis, we see that external knowledge is only helpful when there is alignment between questions and knowledge-base types. Thus, it is crucial to identify the question type and apply the best-suited knowledge. In terms of knowledge-injection methods, attention-based injection seems to be the better choice for pre-trained language models such as BERT. Even when alignment between knowledge-base and dataset is sub-optimal, the performance would not degrade. On the other hand, pre-training on knowledge-bases would shift the language model's weight distribution toward its own domain, greatly. If the task domain does not fit knowledge-base well, model performance is likely to drop. When the domain of the knowledge-base aligns with that of the dataset perfectly, both knowledge-injection methods bring performance boosts and a combination of them could bring further gain.", "We designed methods to extract adequate semantic structures (i.e., triples) from two comprehensive commonsense knowledge graphs, ConceptNet BIBREF6 and Atomic BIBREF7, and to inject this external context into language models.

Assertions and expressions dominate in Entity and Event types with questions beings a distant third, while in Long-standing, recommendations are much more dominant with assertions being less so. This agrees with Zhao et al.'s BIBREF7 findings that tweets about Long-standings topics tend to be more opinionated which would result in more recommendations and expressions and fewer assertions."]}

Among the large number of MRC datasets, RACE focuses primarily on developing MRC models with near-human capability. Questions in RACE come from real English exams designed specifically to test human comprehension.

For a given input sample, DFN can dynamically construct an model instance with a sample-specific network structure by picking an optimal attention strategy and an optimal number of reasoning steps on the fly. The capability allows DFN to adapt effectively to handling questions of different types. By training the policy of model construction with reinforcement learning, our DFN model can substantially outperform previous state-of-the-art MRC models on the challenging RACE dataset. Experiments show that by marrying dynamic fusion (DF) with multi-step reasoning (MR), the performance boost of DFN over baseline models is statistically significant. For future directions, we plan to incorporate more comprehensive attention strategies into the DFN model, and to apply the model to other challenging MRC tasks with more complex questions that need DF and MR jointly.

The algorithm starts with a large vocabulary of words and a set of base characters (e.g., Unicode characters).\n2.

The process is repeated until a desired vocabulary size is reached (e.g., 40k in the text).\n4. Each word is then represented as a sequence of subwords, which can be used as input to a neural machine translation (NMT) model.\n\nIn the context of the text, the subword-level NMT setting uses a vocabulary size of 40k, which means that the model represents words as sequences of subwords, rather than individual words.
