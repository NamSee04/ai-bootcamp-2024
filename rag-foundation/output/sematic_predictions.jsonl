Thus, addressing these barriers is a key challenge for modern translation systems. A large number of MT approaches have been developed over the years that could potentially serve as a remedy. For instance, translators began by using methodologies based on linguistics which led to the family of RBMT. However, RBMT systems have a critical drawback in their reliance on manually crafted rules, thus making the development of new translation modules for different languages even more difficult.", "When an MT system does not recognize an entity, the translation output often has poor quality, immediately deteriorating the target text readability. Therefore, we suggest recognizing such entities before the translation process and first linking them to a reference knowledge base. Afterwards, the type of entities would be agglutinated along with their labels and their translations from a reference knowledge base. For instance, in NMT, the idea is to include in the training set for the aforementioned word \u201cKiwi\", \u201cKiwi.animal.link, Kiwi.person.link, Kiwi.food.link\" then finally to align them with the translations in the target text. For example, in SMT, the additional information can be included by XML or by an additional model. In contrast, in NMT, this additional information can be used as parameters in the training phase. This method would also contribute to OOV mistakes regarding names.

Recall that BERT-PKD initializes the student model by selecting 3 of 12 layers in the pre-trained BERT-Base model. It turns out that the discarded layers have huge impact on the model performance, which is hard to be recovered by knowledge distillation. On the other hand, LadaBERT generates the student model by iterative pruning on the pre-trained teacher.

We think this is because of three reasons: 1) BBN has a much smaller tag set than FIGER (GOLD); 2) BBN does not allow a mention to be annotated with multiple type paths (e.g., labeling a mention with both /building and /location is not allowed), thus the task is easier; 3) By making the model deep, the performance on BBN is already improved a lot, which makes further improvement harder.", "Thus, the use of extra information to help with the classification process becomes very important. In this paper, we improve FET with entity linking (EL).

Such a mistake can be avoided after linking it to the city Federal Way, Washington. For cases that require the understanding of the context, using entity linking results is also beneficial.

For example, in Figure FIGREF4, suppose the example sentence is a training sample obtained from Wikipedia, where \u201cDonald Trump\u201d is an anchor link points to the Wikipedia page of Donald Trump. After mapping the Freebase types of Donald Trump to the target tag set, this sample will be weakly annotated as /person/politician, /person/tv_personality, and /person/business, which is exactly the same as the type information (the \u201cTypes From KB\u201d in Figure FIGREF4) obtained through EL.

If the word in a sentence is out of vocabulary of the parser, it is followed by [?], followed by one of .n, .v, .a, or .e, depending on whether the word is being interpreted as a noun, verb, adjective, or adverb. If a word is enclosed in square brackets, this indicates that the parser was forced to delete this word in order to find a grammatical interpretation of the sentence. The parsing occurs in multiple phases. In the first phase, attempt is made to find \"complete\" linkage for a sentence without leaving out any word, in which all the words are linked together.

Pre-training models have been used to obtain more effective word representations through the study of a large number of corpora. In the paradigm proposed in the original work by Devlin et al.

For example, we set convolution kernel width as 2, the input 2D tensor will have the shape lager than 2. To boost performance with CNN, we need more matching features.

As more layers are fine-tuned, the model effectiveness often improves drastically\u2014see CoLA and STS-B, the first and fourth vertical pairs of subfigures from the left. This demonstrates that gains decompose nonadditively with respect to the number of frozen initial layers. Fine-tuning subsequent layers shows diminishing returns, with every model rapidly approaching the baseline quality at fine-tuning half of the network; hence, we believe that half is a reasonable cutoff point for characterizing the models.", "An emerging line of work questions the need for such a parameter-loaded model, especially on a single downstream task. BIBREF3, for example, note that only a few attention heads need to be retained in each layer for acceptable effectiveness. BIBREF4 find that, on many tasks, just the last few layers change the most after the fine-tuning process. We take these observations as evidence that only the last few layers necessarily need to be fine-tuned."]}

An agreement relation is a morphophonologically overt co-variance in feature values between two words in a syntactic relationship BIBREF20. In other words, agreement refers to when the morphosyntactic features of one word are reflected in its syntactic dependents. In this way, agreement relations are overt markers of covert syntactic structure.

Yet, author-assigned keyphrases commonly found in scientific paper datasets are not perfect either, as they are less constrained BIBREF13 and include seldom-used variants or misspellings that negatively impact performance.

In the context of the LGI model, imagination is demonstrated through its ability to understand and respond to verbal commands, such as rotating a digit or enlarging an object, and then predicting the resulting morphology or properties of the imagined object.\n\nThe authors also distinguish between two types of imagination: a \"full visual loop\" imagination, which involves a more concrete and detailed mental simulation, and a \"short-cut\" imagination, which is a more rapid and vague mental simulation that bypasses the full visual loop. The latter is suggested to be more typical of human thinking, while the former may be related to the dream mechanism.\n\nOverall, the authors' concept of imagination emphasizes its role in facilitating creative problem-solving, hypothetical thinking, and iterative reasoning, and suggests that it is a key component of human cognition that can be replicated in artificial intelligence systems like LGI.", "predicted_evidence": ["Imagination is another key component of human thinking.

In many cases, the two corpora agree in which languages they predict to be used in each country: Europe, those parts of Africa for which there is ground-truth data, and South America. But Twitter provides a better representation of North America and Oceania. One factor that is disguised in these figures is that many countries have only a few languages, so that a high true positive rate for a country could reflect only one or two languages. For example, both English and Spanish are very common on Twitter (c.f. Table 3), so that any country which predominantly uses these two languages will have a good representation by default.", "We can also think about the false positive rate: what languages do the corpora find that are not contained in the census-based ground-truth? For example, if English and Spanish are used in a country on Twitter but not reflected on the census, this is a false positive. As shown in Figure 6, the web-crawled corpus has very few false positive outside of Russia and eastern Europe. The situation on Twitter is similar: most false positives are in Russia and Eastern Europe, but in Twitter there are also over-predicted languages in the US and Canada, South Africa, France, India, and Australia. This is important because it shows that relying on Twitter alone would indicate that there are more diverse language speaking populations in these countries.

The Twitter dataset relies on georeferenced tweets, but not all users have GPS-enabled devices. For example, we might expect that countries with a lower per capita GDP have a lower percent of georeferenced tweets, in addition to having fewer tweets overall.

The implication is that all the other languages make up less than 20% of both datasets. This is potentially problematic because majority languages such as English and Spanish (both very common) are used across widely different demographics. In other words, knowing that a population uses English or Spanish gives us relatively little information about that population. A different view of this is shown in Figure 1, with the distribution by percentage of the data for the top 100 languages in each dataset (not necessarily the same languages). There is a long-tail of minority languages with a relatively small representation. This trend is more extreme in the social media dataset, but it is found with the same order of magnitude in both datasets. The figure is cut off above 2.0% in order to visualize the long-tail of very infrequent languages.

On all 4 combinations (2 features sets INLINEFORM0 2 models) we observe an improvement in terms of precision and NMI but a degradation of the recall.

Indeed, this suggests that even speech from an unrelated language can be of some help in the design of an ASR for a very low resource language. Finally, similarly to the SVAE/HMM case described above, we found that the degradation of the recall is due to longer units discovered for models with an informative prior (numbers omitted due to lack of space)."]}

While some of these responses require urgent attention, given the volume of responses many testing agencies deal with, it is not feasible to systematically review every single student response within a reasonable time-frame. The benefits of an automated system for alert detection is that we can prioritize a small percentage which can be reviewed quickly so that clients can receive alerts within some fixed time period, which is typically 24 hours. Given the prevalence of school shootings and similarly urgent situations, reducing the number of false positives can effectively speed up the review process and hence optimize our clients ability to intervene when necessary."]}

For each image, multiple captions from several candidate models are available, some of which might be rated higher than others. In the setup used in this paper, the low-rated captions serve as negative examples, because human annotators judged them as bad captions (see examples in Figure FIGREF1). $r(c|I)$ is possibly an aggregate of multiple ratings from different raters. Section SECREF23 provides more details of the caption ratings dataset that we employ.", "One approach to address the sparsity of the rating function is to construct a caption quality estimator, while keeping the sampling process on-policy; this is the method adopted in, e.g., BIBREF21, BIBREF27, BIBREF28. Incidentally, it is also the expressed goal for the effort behind the caption ratings dataset in BIBREF13 that we use in this work."]}

For example, Nobata et al. nobata use it to collectively refer to hate speech, derogatory language and profanity, while Mishra et al. mishra use it to discuss racism and sexism. The definitions for different types of abuse tend to be overlapping and ambiguous. However, regardless of the specific type, we define abuse as any expression that is meant to denigrate or offend a particular person or group. Taking a course-grained view, Waseem et al. W17-3012 classify abuse into broad categories based on explicitness and directness. Explicit abuse comes in the form of expletives, derogatory words or threats, while implicit abuse has a more subtle appearance characterized by the presence of ambiguous terms and figures of speech such as metaphor or sarcasm.", "In the context of natural language, abuse is a term that encompasses many different types of fine-grained negative expressions.

We start with an outline of a language for expressing NLP features abstracting over the feature extraction process, which often implicitly captures intent of the NLP data scientist to extract specific features from given input text. We next discuss a method to enable automated reuse of features across semantically related applications when a corpus of feature specifications for related applications is available. Proposed language and system would help achieving reduction in manual effort towards design and extraction of features, would ensure standardization in feature specification process, and could enable effective reuse of features across similar and/or related applications.", "Currently, there is no generic method or approach, which can be applied during TA application's design process to define and extract features for any arbitrary application in an automated or semi-automated manner. Even there is no single way to express wide range of NLP features, resulting into increased efforts during feature engineering which has to start new for each data scientist and automated reuse of features across semantically similar or related applications designed by different data scientists is difficult. This also hinders foundational studies on NLP feature engineering including why certain features are more critical than others."]}

Label `B' stands for Beginning of the aspect terms, `I' for Inside (aspect terms' continuation), and `O' for Outside or non-aspect terms.

Based on our experiments on these separate sets, we find that even the state-of-the-art models can only perform well on EASY set and struggle on HARD set as shown in Figure FIGREF4. This phenomenon shows that current models can well capture the biases in the dataset but lack the ability to understand the text and reason based on connections between the lines. On the other hand, human beings perform similarly on both the EASY and HARD set."]}

Natural languages are not natural but man-made, and linguistical knowledge are also created by human long after natural language appeared.

TensorFlow, PyTorch, CoreML and MXNet have changed the way people write machine learning code to build models. Increasingly, there is a trend toward higher level interfaces. The pioneering work on higher level domain specific languages like Keras began in this direction. Popular libraries like Fast.ai, which created a set of libraries and training materials, have dramatically improved engineer productivity. These resources have made it easier to build models but equally important to train model developers. Enabled in part by this trend, Overton takes a different stance: model development is in some cases not the key to product success. Given a fixed budget of time to run a long-lived ML model, Overton is based on the idea that success or failure depends on engineers being able to iterate quickly and maintain the supervision\u2013not change the model.", "In summary, Overton represents a first-of-its kind machine-learning lifecycle management system that has a focus on monitoring and improving application quality. A key idea is to separate the model and data, which is enabled by a code-free approach to deep learning.

This design is informed and refined from use in production systems for over a year in multiple machine-learned products.", "A major design choice at the outset of the project was that domain engineers should not be forced to write traditional deep learning modeling code. Two years ago, this was a contentious decision as the zeitgeist was that new models were frequently published, and this choice would hamstring the developers. However, as the pace of new model building blocks has slowed, domain engineers no longer feel the need to fine-tune individual components at the level of TensorFlow. Ludwig has taken this approach and garnered adoption. Although developed separately, Overton's schema looks very similar to Ludwig's programs and from conversations with the developers, shared similar motivations. Ludwig, however, focused on the one-off model building process not the management of the model lifecycle. Overton itself only supports text processing, but we are prototyping image, video, and multimodal applications."]}

Byte-pair encoding is a subword modeling technique used in neural machine translation, not directly related to the context provided.\n\nHowever, I can explain how byte-pair encoding works:\n\nByte-pair encoding is a method for encoding words as sequences of subwords, which are smaller units than words. It was introduced as a way to handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and rare words in neural machine translation.\n\nHere's a high-level overview of how BPE works:\n\n1. **Tokenization**: The input text is tokenized into words.\n2. **Frequency analysis**: The frequency of each word in the training data is calculated.\n3. **Byte-pair creation**: The most frequent pair of bytes (characters) in the vocabulary is identified, and a new symbol is created to represent this pair.\n4. **Merging**: The new symbol is added to the vocabulary, and all occurrences of the original byte pair are replaced with the new symbol.\n5. **Repeat**: Steps 2-4 are repeated until a desired vocabulary size is reached or a stopping criterion is met.\n\nThe resulting vocabulary consists of subwords, which are sequences of characters that represent parts of words. These subwords can be used as input to a neural machine translation model, allowing it to handle OOV words and rare words more effectively.\n\nIn the context of neural machine translation, BPE is often used to create a shared vocabulary for both the source and target languages.

However, when using BPE both ReWE and ReWE+ReSE have performed slightly below the baseline ($-0.37$ and $-0.12$ points BLEU pp, respectively). This shows that when the training data are abundant, ReWE or ReSE may not be beneficial. To probe this further, we have repeated these experiments by training the models over subsets of the training set of increasing size (200K, 500K, 1M, and 2M sentence pairs). Fig. FIGREF57 shows the BLEU scores achieved by the baseline and the regularized models for the different training data sizes. The plot clearly shows that the performance margin increases as the training data size decreases, as expected from a regularized model.", "For the eu-en dataset (Table TABREF46), the results show that, again, ReWE outperforms the baselines by a large margin. Moreover, ReWE+ReSE has been able to improve the results even further ($+3.15$ BLEU pp when using BPE and $+5.15$ BLEU pp at word level over the corresponding baselines). Basque is, too, a morphologically-rich language and using BPE has proved very beneficial ($+4.27$ BLEU pp over the best word-level model). As noted before, the eu-en dataset is very low-resource (less than $100,000$ sentence pairs) and it is more likely that the baseline models generalize poorly. Consequently, regularizers such as ReWE and ReSE are more helpful, with larger margins of improvement with respect to the baselines.", "We have carried out a number of experiments with both baselines. The scores reported are an average of the BLEU scores (in percentage points, or pp) BIBREF46 over the test sets of 5 independently trained models. Table TABREF44 shows the results over the en-fr dataset. In this case, the models with ReWE have outperformed the LSTM and transformer baselines consistently. The LSTM did not benefit from using BPE, but the transformer+ReWE with BPE reached $36.30$ BLEU pp (a $+0.99$ pp improvement over the best model without ReWE). For this dataset we did not use ReSE because French was the target language."]}
